Improvements - 1. Create an in website app for the converter so people can search it up
               2. If the app was created on a website a map could be added to pick to places and measure/ convert the distances
Limitaions - 1. User has to download the file and run in in visual studio code or alternatinve
             2. The app doesnt have any onther distance measurements other than the ones listed
